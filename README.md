## Into the assignemnts:

### Assignment 1

Created and trained different models on CIFAR10 using SGD and simple numpy  
Models trained:
1. Simple Model with SVMLoss
2. Simple Model with SoftmaxLoss 
3. Multi-Layer Neural Networks  

Did some analysis of the models:
1. Analyse accuracies as function of different things like number of layers, activation function, etc.
2. Visualize weights of models to see any patterns
3. Loss plots 

Improvements on the models using some techniques like hyperparameter search, cross-validation


##### NOTE: I will be updtating my version of the homework on this repository a week after the submission deadline to avoid any honor code violations.

##### I will post more details about the assignments here, as and when required.
